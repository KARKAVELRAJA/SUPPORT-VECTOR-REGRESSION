# SUPPORT-VECTOR-REGRESSION

### IMPLEMENTION OF SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY TO PREDICT SALARY

- Support Vector Regression is a supervised learning algorithm
- The basic idea behind Support Vector Regression is to find the best fit line. In SVR, the best fit line is the hyperplane that has the maximum number of points
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and tested
- Finally, the accuracy of the model is predicted
